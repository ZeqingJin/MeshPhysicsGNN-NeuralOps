# MeshPhysicsGNN-NeuralOps

In this paper, we developed graph neural network (GNN) models with enhanced generalizability derived from the distinct GNN architecture and neural operator technique. As a proof of concept, we employ our GNN models to predict finite element (FE) simulation results for three-dimensional solid mechanics problems with varying boundary conditions. Results show that our GNN model achieves accurate and robust performance in predicting the stress and deformation profiles of structures compared with FE simulations. Furthermore, the neural operator embedded GNN approach enables learning and predicting various solid mechanics problems in a generalizable fashion, making it a promising approach for surrogate modeling.
